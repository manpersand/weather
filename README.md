## My first react app. 

![Demo Screenshot](weather.png)

### A simple weather widget that displays the current temperature and weather condition for a city provided by user. Temperature below 12ºC is considered cool and above 12ºC is considered hot. The background color of the weather card changes according to the temperature.

React libraries used:
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animation
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) for styled components
- [React Reel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-reel) for the reel effect of temperature

A config.json file that contains an api key from OpenWeather is required in the src folder.  

format for the config.json file:  
`{ "apiKey": "**_your key here_**" }`
